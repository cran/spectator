Description: Provides interface to the 'Spectator Earth' API <https://api.spectator.earth/>, 
    mainly for obtaining the acquisition plans and satellite overpasses for
    Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 satellites. Current position and
    trajectory can also be obtained for a much larger set of satellites.
    It is also possible to search the archive for available images over
    the area of interest for a given (past) period, get the URL links to
    download the whole image tiles, or alternatively to download the image
    for just the area of interest based on selected spectral bands.
