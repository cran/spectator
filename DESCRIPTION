Description: Provides interface to the 'Spectator Earth' API <https://api.spectator.earth/>, 
    mainly for obtaining the acquisition plans and satellite overpasses for Sentinel-1, 
    Sentinel-2, Landsat-8 and Landsat-9 satellites. Current position and trajectory can 
    also be obtained for a much larger set of satellites. It is also possible to search 
    the archive for available images over the area of interest for a given (past) period, 
    get the URL links to download the whole image tiles, or alternatively to download the 
    image for just the area of interest based on selected spectral bands.
